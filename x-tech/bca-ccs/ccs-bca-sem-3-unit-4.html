        <section class="section">
            <h2>1. The Scope and Method of Economics</h2>
            <p>
                Economics studies how individuals, businesses, and societies allocate scarce resources to satisfy
                unlimited wants. It involves analyzing trade-offs, opportunity costs, and decision-making processes.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microeconomics:</strong> Focuses on individual units like households and firms.</li>
                <li><strong>Macroeconomics:</strong> Deals with economy-wide phenomena like GDP, inflation, and
                    unemployment.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>2. The Economic Problem: Scarcity and Choice</h2>
            <p>
                The economic problem arises due to limited resources and unlimited wants, necessitating choices about
                what, how, and for whom to produce.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Scarcity: Limited natural resources (e.g., oil).
    Choice: Allocate resources between energy production and transportation.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>3. The Price Mechanism</h2>
            <p>
                The price mechanism refers to the system where supply and demand interact to determine prices and
                allocate resources efficiently.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    High Demand → Prices Rise → Producers Increase Supply
    Low Demand → Prices Fall → Producers Decrease Supply
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>4. Demand and Supply Equilibrium</h2>
            <p>
                The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, creating market
                stability.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Demand: 100 units at $10, 50 units at $20
    Supply: 50 units at $10, 100 units at $20
    Equilibrium: 75 units at $15
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>5. The Concept of Elasticity and Its Applications</h2>
            <p>
                Elasticity measures the responsiveness of demand or supply to changes in price, income, or other
                factors.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Price Elasticity of Demand:</strong> Percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the
                    percentage change in price.</li>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Pricing strategies, tax policies, and revenue optimization.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Price Elasticity = (% Change in Quantity) / (% Change in Price)
    Elastic Demand: >1, Inelastic Demand: <1
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>6. The Production Process: Output Decisions</h2>
            <p>
                Firms decide output levels to maximize revenues, minimize costs, and optimize profits. This involves
                understanding costs, revenues, and market conditions.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Revenue = Price × Quantity
    Profit = Revenue - Cost
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>7. Laws of Returns and Returns to Scale</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Laws of Returns:</strong> Analyze how output changes with varying input levels in the short
                run.<br>
                <strong>Returns to Scale:</strong> Measure how output changes when all inputs are scaled proportionally
                in the long run.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increasing Returns to Scale:</strong> Output increases more than inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Constant Returns to Scale:</strong> Output increases proportionally to inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Decreasing Returns to Scale:</strong> Output increases less than inputs.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Inputs: Double
    Output:
    - Increasing Returns: Output triples
    - Constant Returns: Output doubles
    - Decreasing Returns: Output increases by 1.5 times
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>8. Economies and Diseconomies of Scale</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Economies of Scale:</strong> Cost advantages due to increased production (e.g., bulk
                purchasing).<br>
                <strong>Diseconomies of Scale:</strong> Increased costs due to inefficiencies at higher production
                levels (e.g., management challenges).
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Economies: Lower unit cost with larger production.
    Diseconomies: Rising unit cost due to overproduction.

            <h2>1. Equilibrium of a Firm</h2>
            <p>
                The equilibrium of a firm occurs when it maximizes profit, where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal
                revenue (MR). The firm adjusts output levels to ensure this condition.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - Marginal Cost (MC): Cost of producing one additional unit.
    - Marginal Revenue (MR): Revenue earned from selling one additional unit.
    Equilibrium: MC = MR
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>2. Price and Output Determination under Perfect Competition</h2>
            <p>
                In perfect competition, many firms produce identical products, and no single firm can influence the
                market price. Price is determined by the intersection of market demand and supply.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Market Price: $10
    Firm's Output: Produces at MC = MR = $10
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>3. Price and Output Determination under Monopoly</h2>
            <p>
                A monopoly exists when a single firm controls the market. The monopolist determines the price and output
                by maximizing profit, producing where MR = MC.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Demand Curve: Downward sloping
    Equilibrium: Produces less and charges higher price than in perfect competition.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>4. Price and Output Determination under Monopolistic Competition</h2>
            <p>
                In monopolistic competition, many firms sell similar but not identical products. Price and output are
                determined based on differentiation and market demand.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - Firms differentiate through branding, quality, or advertising.
    - Equilibrium: Produces where MR = MC and charges a price above marginal cost.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>5. Price and Output Determination under Oligopoly</h2>
            <p>
                An oligopoly exists when a few firms dominate the market. Pricing and output decisions are
                interdependent and often involve strategic behavior like collusion or competition.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collusion:</strong> Firms agree on price/output to maximize joint profits (e.g., cartels).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Competition:</strong> Firms compete, leading to price wars or innovation.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - Firms A and B in an oligopoly.
    - Firm A lowers price → Firm B responds to maintain market share.

            <h2>1. Inflation</h2>
            <p>
                Inflation refers to the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an
                economy over a period of time. It reduces the purchasing power of money.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Types of Inflation:
    - Demand-Pull Inflation: Caused by high demand.
    - Cost-Push Inflation: Caused by rising production costs.
    Example: Price of essential goods rising by 10% annually.

        <section class="section">
            <h2>2. Unemployment</h2>
            <p>
                Unemployment occurs when individuals who are capable of working and are actively seeking work cannot
                find employment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frictional Unemployment:</strong> Short-term, due to transitions between jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Structural Unemployment:</strong> Due to a mismatch of skills and job requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyclical Unemployment:</strong> Caused by economic downturns.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    An increase in layoffs during a recession, leading to higher cyclical unemployment.

            <h2>3. Trade Cycles</h2>
            <p>
                Trade cycles, or business cycles, are the fluctuations in economic activity characterized by periods of
                expansion and contraction.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phases:</strong> Boom, Recession, Depression, Recovery</li>

            <h2>4. Circular Flow (Four-Sector Economy)</h2>
            <p>
                The circular flow of income and expenditure illustrates how money flows between households, businesses,
                government, and the foreign sector.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - Households provide labor → Firms pay wages.
