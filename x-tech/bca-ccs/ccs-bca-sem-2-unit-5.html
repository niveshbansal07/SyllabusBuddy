            <p><strong>Capitalization</strong> refers to the total amount of capital employed in a business, including
                equity, debt, and retained earnings.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Types:</strong></li>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">

            <h2>6. Measurement of Cost of Capital</h2>
            <p>Calculating the cost of capital involves assessing different components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost of Debt:</strong> Interest payments on borrowed funds adjusted for tax savings.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost of Equity:</strong> Return expected by equity investors.</li>
                <li><strong>Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):</strong> Weighted average of debt and equity costs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
