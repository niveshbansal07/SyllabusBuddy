    <h1>UNIT-I: Sets</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction to Sets</h2>
        <p>A <strong>set</strong> is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects in a set are called its elements or members. Sets are usually represented using curly braces, e.g., <code>{a, b, c}</code>.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    Set B = {x | x is a vowel in the English alphabet} = {a, e, i, o, u}
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Subsets</h2>
        <p>A set <code>A</code> is a <strong>subset</strong> of set <code>B</code> if all elements of <code>A</code> are also elements of <code>B</code>. This is denoted as <code>A ⊆ B</code>.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    Since all elements of A are in B, A ⊆ B.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Equal Sets</h2>
        <p>Two sets are <strong>equal</strong> if they have the same elements, irrespective of the order. This is denoted as <code>A = B</code>.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 2, 1}
    Since both sets have the same elements, A = B.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Universal Set</h2>
        <p>The <strong>universal set</strong> is the set that contains all the elements under consideration, typically denoted by <code>U</code>. All other sets are subsets of the universal set.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, A = {1, 2}, B = {4, 5}
    Here, U is the universal set.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Finite and Infinite Sets</h2>
        <p>A set is <strong>finite</strong> if it has a limited number of elements. Otherwise, it is called <strong>infinite</strong>.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Finite Set: A = {1, 2, 3}
    Infinite Set: B = {x | x is a natural number}
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Operations on Sets</h2>
        <p>Operations such as <strong>Union</strong>, <strong>Intersection</strong>, and <strong>Complement</strong> are commonly performed on sets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Union (A ∪ B):</strong> The set containing all elements from A and B.</li>
            <li><strong>Intersection (A ∩ B):</strong> The set containing common elements of A and B.</li>
            <li><strong>Complement (A'): </strong> The set of elements in the universal set but not in A.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 4, 5}, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    A ∩ B = {3}
    A' = {4, 5}
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Cartesian Product</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Cartesian product</strong> of two sets A and B, denoted as <code>A × B</code>, is the set of all ordered pairs <code>(a, b)</code> where <code>a ∈ A</code> and <code>b ∈ B</code>.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = {1, 2}, B = {x, y}
    A × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)}
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>8. Cardinality of a Set</h2>
        <p>The <strong>cardinality</strong> of a set refers to the number of elements in the set, denoted as <code>|A|</code>.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    |A| = 4
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>9. Simple Applications of Sets</h2>
        <p>Sets are widely used in various fields such as computer science, mathematics, and logic. They are used for database operations, defining groups in algebra, and problem-solving in probability and statistics.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Problem: Find students enrolled in both Math and Science.
    Math = {John, Alice, Bob}
    Science = {Alice, Bob, Clara}
    Math ∩ Science = {Alice, Bob}

    <h1>UNIT-II: Relations and Functions</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Properties of Relations</h2>
        <p>A <strong>relation</strong> is a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets, describing how elements of the first set are related to elements of the second set. Relations have various properties, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reflexive:</strong> Every element is related to itself. For all <code>a</code> in set A, <code>(a, a) ∈ R</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Symmetric:</strong> If <code>(a, b) ∈ R</code>, then <code>(b, a) ∈ R</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Transitive:</strong> If <code>(a, b) ∈ R</code> and <code>(b, c) ∈ R</code>, then <code>(a, c) ∈ R</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = {1, 2, 3}, R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)}
    Reflexive: (1, 1), (2, 2)
    Symmetric: (2, 3) and (3, 2)
    Transitive: No violation observed.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Equivalence Relation</h2>
        <p>A relation is an <strong>equivalence relation</strong> if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Equivalence relations partition a set into equivalence classes.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = {1, 2, 3}, R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2)}
    R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Hence, R is an equivalence relation.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Partial Order Relation</h2>
        <p>A relation is a <strong>partial order relation</strong> if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. It defines a partial ordering among elements.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = {1, 2, 3}, R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)}
    R is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Hence, R is a partial order relation.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Functions: Domain and Range</h2>
        <p>A <strong>function</strong> is a special relation where each element of the domain is associated with exactly one element of the codomain. The <strong>domain</strong> is the set of all input values, and the <strong>range</strong> is the set of all output values.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    f(x) = x²
    Domain: All real numbers
    Range: Non-negative real numbers
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Onto, Into, and One-to-One Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions can be classified based on their mapping:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Onto:</strong> Every element of the codomain is mapped to at least once.</li>
            <li><strong>Into:</strong> Not all elements of the codomain are mapped.</li>
            <li><strong>One-to-One:</strong> Each element of the domain maps to a unique element of the codomain.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    f(x) = x²
    Domain: {1, 2, 3}
    Codomain: {1, 4, 9, 16}
    Range: {1, 4, 9}
    This is an "into" function.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Composite and Inverse Functions</h2>
        <p>The <strong>composite function</strong> of two functions f and g is defined as <code>(f∘g)(x) = f(g(x))</code>. The <strong>inverse function</strong> of f, denoted as <code>f⁻¹</code>, reverses the mapping of f.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    f(x) = 2x, g(x) = x + 1
    Composite: (f∘g)(x) = f(g(x)) = 2(x + 1) = 2x + 2
    Inverse: If f(x) = 2x, then f⁻¹(x) = x / 2
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Introduction to Trigonometric Functions</h2>
        <p><strong>Trigonometric functions</strong> are based on angles and include sine, cosine, tangent, and their reciprocals. They are widely used in geometry and periodic functions.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    sin(30°) = 1/2, cos(30°) = √3/2, tan(30°) = 1/√3
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>8. Logarithmic and Exponential Functions</h2>
        <p><strong>Logarithmic functions</strong> are the inverses of exponential functions. The general form is <code>log_b(x)</code>, where <code>b</code> is the base. Exponential functions are of the form <code>a^x</code>.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Exponential: f(x) = 2^x, f(3) = 2³ = 8
    Logarithmic: g(x) = log₂(x), g(8) = 3

        <h2>1. Partial Order Sets</h2>
        <p>A <strong>partial order set (poset)</strong> is a set paired with a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. A poset provides a partial ordering of elements.</p>

    Example:
    Set A = {1, 2, 3}
    Relation R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)}

        <h2>1. Partial Differentiation</h2>
        <p><strong>Partial differentiation</strong> is the process of finding the derivative of a function with respect to one variable while keeping the other variables constant. It is used to study functions of multiple variables.</p>

        <p>In <strong>3D Coordinate Geometry</strong>, a point is represented by its coordinates <code>(x, y, z)</code> in a 3D space, where <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> are distances along the respective axes.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A point P(2, 3, 5) is located at 2 units along x-axis, 3 units along y-axis, and 5 units along z-axis.

        <h2>2. Direction Cosines and Angles Between Two Lines</h2>
        <p>The <strong>direction cosines</strong> of a line are the cosines of the angles it makes with the coordinate axes. The angle between two lines can be found using:</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    cos(θ) = (l₁l₂ + m₁m₂ + n₁n₂) / √(l₁² + m₁² + n₁²) √(l₂² + m₂² + n₂²)
    where l, m, n are direction cosines.
    Example:
    For lines L₁ (2, 3, -1) and L₂ (1, -1, 2):
    cos(θ) = (2×1 + 3×(-1) + (-1)×2) / √(2² + 3² + (-1)²)√(1² + (-1)² + 2²)
    Result: cos(θ) = -0.1

        <h2>6. Conditions for a Line to Lie on a Plane</h2>
        <p>A line lies on a plane if its direction vector satisfies the plane equation, and the given point of the line also satisfies the plane equation.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Line: x = 1 + 2λ, y = 2 + λ, z = 3 - λ
    Plane: 2x - y + z = 7
    Check: Substituting x, y, z:
    2(1 + 2λ) - (2 + λ) + (3 - λ) = 7
