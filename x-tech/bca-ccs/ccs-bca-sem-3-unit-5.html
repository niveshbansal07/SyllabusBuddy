    <h1>UNIT-II: Measures of Central Tendency</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Concept of Central Tendency</h2>
        <p>
            Measures of central tendency describe a central or typical value for a dataset. They summarize data with a single representative value to analyze distributions effectively.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - Test Scores: {50, 60, 70, 80, 90}
    - Central Tendency: A single value representing the dataset, such as 70.

    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Arithmetic Mean</h2>
        <p>
            The arithmetic mean is the sum of all data points divided by the total number of data points. It is sensitive to extreme values.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Formula: Mean = (Σx) / n
    Example:
    Data: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
    Mean = (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50) / 5 = 30

    <h1>UNIT-III: Measures of Dispersion</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Concept of Dispersion</h2>
        <p>
            Dispersion refers to the spread or variability of a dataset. It provides insights into how data points are distributed around a central value, highlighting the degree of consistency or variability.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Dataset A: {5, 5, 5, 5, 5} → Low dispersion
    Dataset B: {1, 5, 9, 13, 17} → High dispersion
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Absolute and Relative Measures of Dispersion</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Absolute Measures:</strong> Expressed in the same units as the data (e.g., range, variance, standard deviation).<br>
            <strong>Relative Measures:</strong> Expressed as ratios or percentages, enabling comparison across datasets (e.g., coefficient of variation).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Range</h2>
        <p>
            The range is the simplest measure of dispersion, calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Formula: Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value
    Example:
    Dataset: {4, 8, 15, 16, 23}
    Range = 23 - 4 = 19
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Variance</h2>
        <p>
            Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It indicates the data's variability.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Formula: Variance (σ²) = Σ(Xi - X̄)² / N
    Example:
    Dataset: {2, 4, 6}
    Mean (X̄) = 4
    Variance = [(2-4)² + (4-4)² + (6-4)²] / 3 = 2.67
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Standard Deviation</h2>
        <p>
            The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of dispersion in the same units as the data.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Formula: Standard Deviation (σ) = √Variance
    Example:
    Dataset: {2, 4, 6}
    Variance = 2.67
    Standard Deviation = √2.67 = 1.63
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Coefficient of Variation (CV)</h2>
        <p>
            The coefficient of variation is a relative measure of dispersion, calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Formula: CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) × 100%
    Example:
    Dataset: {2, 4, 6}
    Mean = 4, Standard Deviation = 1.63
    CV = (1.63 / 4) × 100 = 40.75%

        <h2>2. Control Limits, Specification Limits, and Tolerance Limits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Control Limits:</strong> Statistical boundaries within which a process operates under control.</li>
            <li><strong>Specification Limits:</strong> Defined limits of product performance as per customer requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Tolerance Limits:</strong> Acceptable range of variation in a product’s characteristics.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - Control Limits: Derived from process data (e.g., ±3 standard deviations from the mean).
    - Specification Limits: Set by customer requirements (e.g., 10 ± 0.2 cm).

        <h2>3. Process and Product Control</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Process Control:</strong> Ensures that a process remains stable and consistent over time.<br>
            <strong>Product Control:</strong> Focuses on inspecting the final product to ensure quality standards are met.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - Process Control: Monitoring temperature during production.
    - Product Control: Inspecting finished items for defects.
        </pre>

        <h2>4. Control Charts for X and R</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>X-Chart:</strong> Monitors the mean of a process over time.<br>
            <strong>R-Chart:</strong> Monitors the range (variability) of a process over time.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - X-Chart: Tracks average weight of items produced.
    - R-Chart: Tracks variation in weights of items produced.

        <h2>5. Control Charts for Number of Defectives (n-p Chart)</h2>
        <p>
            The n-p chart monitors the number of defective items in a sample of constant size. It is used when the output can either be defective or non-defective.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - Sample size: 100 items.
    - Defective items: Tracked over several batches.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Control Charts for Number of Defects (c-Chart)</h2>
        <p>
            The c-chart monitors the count of defects in a sample of constant size. It is used when defects can occur multiple times on a single item.
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    - Product: A fabric roll.
    - Defects: Number of tears, stains, or misprints per roll.
