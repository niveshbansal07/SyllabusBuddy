        <section class="section">
            <h2>1. Nature, Scope, Definition, and Goals of Organizational Behaviour</h2>
            <p><strong>Organizational Behaviour (OB)</strong> is the study of how individuals, groups, and structures
                affect and are affected by behavior within organizations. Its aim is to improve organizational
                effectiveness.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Multidisciplinary, dynamic, and situational.</li>
                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Includes individual behavior, group behavior, and organizational structure.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> OB is the study of human behavior in organizational settings, the
                    interface between human behavior and the organization, and the organization itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Goals:</strong> To explain, predict, and influence behavior to improve productivity and
                    satisfaction.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A company may use OB principles to improve teamwork or address employee grievances.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>2. Fundamental Concepts of Organizational Behaviour</h2>
            <p>The key concepts underlying OB are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Individual Differences:</strong> Each person is unique and reacts differently in similar
                    situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Perception:</strong> How individuals interpret their environment influences their behavior.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Employees are motivated by different factors, such as rewards,
                    recognition, or personal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Job Satisfaction:</strong> Positive feelings about one’s job contribute to higher
                    performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Dynamics:</strong> The interaction and cooperation among group members affect outcomes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>3. Models of Organizational Behaviour</h2>
            <p>OB models provide frameworks to understand and manage behaviors in organizations. Key models include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Autocratic Model:</strong> Focuses on authority, control, and obedience.</li>
                <li><strong>Custodial Model:</strong> Emphasizes financial security and employee benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Supportive Model:</strong> Encourages leadership and employee engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Collegial Model:</strong> Promotes teamwork and shared responsibility.</li>
                <li><strong>System Model:</strong> Integrates social, psychological, and economic factors to enhance
                    work environments.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A company adopting the supportive model might focus on mentorship programs and employee recognition.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>4. Emerging Aspects of Organizational Behaviour</h2>
            <h3>a. Cultural Diversity</h3>
            <p><strong>Cultural Diversity</strong> refers to the presence of employees from varied cultural backgrounds,
                which can enhance creativity but also pose challenges in communication and integration.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A multicultural team in a global organization might bring innovative ideas but require cultural sensitivity training.
        </pre>

            <h3>b. Managing the Perception Process</h3>
            <p>Perception is the process by which individuals interpret sensory information. Effective perception
                management can reduce misunderstandings and biases.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perceptual Selectivity:</strong> The process of filtering out unnecessary information.</li>
                <li><strong>Perceptual Organization:</strong> Grouping and structuring information meaningfully.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Assigning meaning to organized information.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Managers can use clear communication and feedback to manage perceptions and align team objectives.

        <section class="section">
            <h2>1. Concept, Nature, and Process of Perception</h2>
            <p><strong>Perception</strong> is the process through which individuals interpret and make sense of sensory
                information to understand their environment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Subjective, selective, and influenced by individual and situational
                    factors.</li>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> Involves sensory input, attention, organization, interpretation, and
                    response.</li>
                <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Influences decision-making, problem-solving, and interactions in
                    organizations.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A manager perceives an employee's tardiness differently based on their personal biases or past experiences.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>2. Management Behavioural Aspect of Perception</h2>
            <p>Managers must understand and manage perceptual biases, such as stereotypes, halo effects, and selective
                perception, to improve decision-making and employee relations.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Avoiding stereotypes helps managers assess employees' skills and performance objectively.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>3. Attitudes and Effects on Employee Behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Attitudes</strong> are learned predispositions to respond in a consistently favorable or
                unfavorable manner. They affect job performance, organizational commitment, and morale.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive Attitudes:</strong> Lead to higher productivity, cooperation, and innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Negative Attitudes:</strong> Cause absenteeism, conflict, and low job satisfaction.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    An employee with a positive attitude toward teamwork contributes more effectively to group projects.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>4. Personal and Organizational Values</h2>
            <p><strong>Values</strong> are principles that guide behavior. Personal values influence individual actions,
                while organizational values shape the work culture.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Personal value: Integrity
    Organizational value: Transparency
    Alignment between these values promotes trust and ethical behavior.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>5. Job Satisfaction</h2>
            <p>Job satisfaction is the positive feeling an employee has about their job. It depends on factors like work
                conditions, salary, relationships, and opportunities for growth.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Providing employees with recognition and development opportunities increases their job satisfaction.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>6. Nature and Importance of Motivation</h2>
            <p><strong>Motivation</strong> drives individuals to achieve goals. It can be intrinsic (self-driven) or
                extrinsic (externally driven).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Dynamic, needs-based, and goal-oriented.</li>
                <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Enhances productivity, reduces turnover, and fosters job satisfaction.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A motivated sales team achieves higher targets and better customer satisfaction.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>7. Achievement Motive</h2>
            <p>The <strong>achievement motive</strong> refers to the desire to excel, achieve standards, and strive for
                success. High achievers prefer challenging tasks and responsibility.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    An employee with high achievement motivation might take the lead on a critical project to demonstrate competence.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>8. Theories of Work Motivation</h2>
            <h3>a. Maslow’s Need Hierarchy Theory</h3>
            <p>Maslow proposed a five-level hierarchy of needs: physiological, safety, social, esteem, and
                self-actualization. Fulfillment of lower-level needs motivates individuals to pursue higher-level needs.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A company providing competitive salaries fulfills employees' physiological needs, encouraging them to seek esteem and self-actualization.
        </pre>

            <h3>b. McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y</h3>
            <p>
                McGregor categorized management assumptions about employees into two models:
                <strong>Theory X:</strong> Assumes employees are lazy and require strict supervision.
                <strong>Theory Y:</strong> Assumes employees are self-motivated and seek responsibility.
            </p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A Theory X manager might micromanage tasks, while a Theory Y manager encourages autonomy and creativity.

        <h1>UNIT-III: Personality</h1>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>1. Definition of Personality</h2>
            <p><strong>Personality</strong> refers to the unique and stable patterns of thoughts, feelings, and
                behaviors that characterize an individual. It influences how people interact with their environment and
                others.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A confident and extroverted individual may excel in roles requiring public speaking and networking.
        </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>2. Determinants of Personality</h2>
            <p>Personality is shaped by various factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heredity:</strong> Genetic predispositions influence traits such as temperament and
                    intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Includes cultural, social, and familial influences.</li>
                <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Personality expression can vary depending on context and circumstances.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    While heredity might determine a tendency towards introversion, a supportive environment can encourage social engagement.

        <section class="section">
            <h2>3. Theories of Personality</h2>
            <h3>a. Trait and Type Theories</h3>
            <p><strong>Trait theories</strong> focus on identifying and measuring individual traits, while <strong>type
                    theories</strong> categorize personalities into fixed types.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Trait: High agreeableness suggests cooperative behavior.
    Type: Carl Jung's theory classifies individuals as introverts or extroverts.
        </pre>

            <h3>b. The Big Five Traits</h3>
            <p>The Big Five model identifies five broad dimensions of personality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Openness:</strong> Creativity and willingness to explore new ideas.</li>
                <li><strong>Conscientiousness:</strong> Organization and responsibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Extraversion:</strong> Sociability and assertiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Agreeableness:</strong> Compassion and cooperation.</li>
                <li><strong>Neuroticism:</strong> Emotional stability versus anxiety.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    An individual high in conscientiousness is likely to meet deadlines consistently.
        </pre>

            <h3>c. Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</h3>
            <p>The MBTI classifies personalities into 16 types based on preferences in four dimensions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introversion (I) vs. Extraversion (E)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)</strong></li>

            <h2>4. Locus of Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Locus of Control</strong> refers to the extent to which individuals believe they have control

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internal Locus:</strong> Belief that outcomes are determined by personal actions.</li>
