        <h2>1. Process Modeling with Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)</strong> are graphical tools used to represent the flow of data through a system. They help in understanding how data is processed, stored, and transferred.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logical DFD:</strong> Focuses on what the system does, without implementation details.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical DFD:</strong> Shows how the system is implemented, including hardware, files, and programs used.</li>
            <li><strong>DFD Symbols:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong> Oval or circle – shows data transformation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Flow:</strong> Arrow – shows data movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Store:</strong> Open rectangle – represents files or databases.</li>
                    <li><strong>External Entity:</strong> Square – source or destination of data.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> How entities are connected (e.g., "enrolls in").</li>
            <li><strong>Types of Relationships:</strong> One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Student(ID, Name, Email)
Course(Code, Title, Credits)
Relationship: Student "enrolls in" Course

One Student → can enroll in many Courses (1:M)
One Course → can have many Students (M:M)
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Logical ERD</h2>
        <p>Logical ERDs represent the business requirements of the system in terms of entities and relationships, independent of the database software or implementation details.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Entities: Customer, Order
Attributes:
- Customer: ID, Name, Phone
- Order: OrderID, Date, Amount
Relationship: Customer "places" Order (1:M)

    <h1>UNIT-V: Design and Implementation on Object-Oriented (OO) Platform</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)</h2>
        <p><strong>OOAD</strong> is a methodology for analyzing and designing a system by visualizing it as a group of interacting objects, each defined by its class, attributes, and behaviors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA):</strong> Focuses on understanding and modeling the problem domain using objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Design (OOD):</strong> Converts analysis models into detailed design models, ready for implementation.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
In a University System:
- Classes: Student, Professor, Course
- Behaviors: Student registers(), Professor assignsGrade()
OOA identifies classes; OOD defines relationships and interactions.
        </pre>

        <h2>2. Object Modeling Technique (OMT)</h2>
        <p><strong>Object Modeling Technique</strong> by James Rumbaugh provides a structured method for modeling systems using three models:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Object Model:</strong> Represents the static structure using classes and associations.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Model:</strong> Shows system behavior over time using state diagrams.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional Model:</strong> Describes data transformations using data flow diagrams (DFDs).</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Object Model → Class: Account (Attributes: balance, owner)
Dynamic Model → State: Active → Overdrawn → Closed
Functional Model → Input: Deposit → Process: Update → Output: New Balance
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Object Modeling</h2>
        <p><strong>Object Modeling</strong> defines the objects, their classes, attributes, methods, and relationships in the system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Class:</strong> Template for objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Data stored in an object.</li>
            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Functions associated with an object.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Class: Book
Attributes: title, author, ISBN
Methods: issue(), return(), checkAvailability()
Relationship: A Library has many Books (1:M)
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Dynamic Modeling</h2>
        <p><strong>Dynamic Modeling</strong> captures how objects behave and interact over time. It uses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>State Diagrams:</strong> Show states and transitions of an object.</li>
            <li><strong>Sequence Diagrams:</strong> Show object interactions in a time sequence.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
ATM Card State Diagram:
States → Inserted → Verified → Transaction Processing → Ejected
Transitions based on user actions and validations.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Functional Object-Oriented Design</h2>
        <p>This approach merges traditional functional decomposition with object-oriented design. It ensures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Well-defined class responsibilities</li>
            <li>Separation of concerns between data and behavior</li>
            <li>Modular and reusable code</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Class: Invoice
Function: calculateTotal() → Calls calculateTax(), applyDiscount()
All logic grouped logically inside the class → clean & reusable.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Object-Oriented Programming Systems (OOPS)</h2>
        <p><strong>OOPS</strong> is the implementation of OOAD concepts using programming languages like Java, C++, or Python.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example (Java):
class Animal {
    void speak() { System.out.println("Sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void speak() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}
Polymorphism: Animal a = new Dog(); → a.speak() → Outputs "Bark"
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Object-Oriented Databases (OODB)</h2>
        <p><strong>Object-Oriented Databases</strong> store data as objects, similar to OOP languages. They support class hierarchies, methods, and complex data types.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is accessed using object-oriented query languages (OQL)</li>
            <li>Supports persistence of objects without conversion to tables</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Object: Student(Name, RollNo, Courses[])
Can be saved and retrieved as an object in OODB like db4o or ObjectDB
No need for SQL table conversion → seamless with OOP code

- Resources: 2 developers, 1 designer, 2 months
- Plan: Week-by-week tasks scheduled
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Size and Cost Estimation</h2>
        <p><strong>Size estimation</strong> measures how big the software is, and <strong>cost estimation</strong> predicts the budget required to develop it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Function Point (FP):</strong> Counts functionalities like inputs, outputs, user interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Lines of Code (LOC):</strong> Counts the number of lines in the final codebase.</li>
            <li><strong>COCOMO Model:</strong> A mathematical model to estimate cost based on size.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Estimated LOC = 5,000
Developer cost = ₹25/LOC → Total = ₹1,25,000
Add testing, documentation, buffer = Total ~ ₹1.5 lakhs
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Project Scheduling</h2>
        <p><strong>Scheduling</strong> involves defining a timeline for each task and milestone. Tools used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gantt Chart:</strong> Bar chart showing tasks over time.</li>
            <li><strong>PERT Chart:</strong> Diagram that shows task dependencies and timelines.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Gantt Chart shows:
Week 1–2: Requirement gathering  
Week 3–5: Design  
Week 6–9: Coding  
Week 10–11: Testing  
Week 12: Deployment
        </pre>

        <h2>5. Measuring Software Quality and Productivity</h2>
        <p><strong>Software Quality</strong> ensures the product is reliable, secure, and meets user needs. <strong>Productivity</strong> measures how efficiently a team delivers software.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Defect Density:</strong> Number of bugs per 1,000 LOC</li>
            <li><strong>Test Coverage:</strong> % of code covered by automated tests</li>
            <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> LOC or features delivered per developer per month</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
- 10 defects in 2000 LOC → Defect Density = 5 per 1,000 LOC  
- 1 developer delivers 500 LOC/week → Good productivity
        </pre>

        <h2>6. ISO and Capability Maturity Models (CMM)</h2>
        <p><strong>ISO (International Organization for Standardization)</strong> provides global standards for quality management in software (e.g., ISO 9001).</p>
        <p><strong>Capability Maturity Model (CMM)</strong> helps organizations improve their software processes through 5 maturity levels:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Initial – Ad hoc and chaotic process</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Repeatable – Basic processes established</li>
            <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Defined – Organization-wide standards followed</li>
            <li><strong>Level 4:</strong> Managed – Metrics are used to monitor processes</li>
            <li><strong>Level 5:</strong> Optimizing – Continuous process improvement</li>
        </ol>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A company at CMM Level 3 has defined coding standards and testing procedures.  
At Level 5, it uses AI-based tools to optimize project delivery continuously.
