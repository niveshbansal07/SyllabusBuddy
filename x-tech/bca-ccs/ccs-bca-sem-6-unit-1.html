    <h1>UNIT-I: Introduction to Network Security and Cryptography</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Attacks, Services, and Security Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>Computer networks are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Understanding them helps in building secure systems.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attack:</strong> Any action that compromises the security of information.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Services:</strong> Functions that enhance security, such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Mechanisms:</strong> Tools or techniques that implement services (e.g., encryption, firewalls, digital signatures).</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A hacker intercepts login data (attack), so SSL encryption (mechanism) is used to ensure data confidentiality (service).
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Model for Internetwork Security</h2>
        <p>A general security model includes the following components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sender and Receiver:</strong> Endpoints that need to communicate securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission Medium:</strong> The insecure network used for data transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Transformations:</strong> Processes like encryption applied to secure the message.</li>
            <li><strong>Secret Information:</strong> Keys used in encryption/decryption.</li>
            <li><strong>Trusted Third Party:</strong> Like a Certificate Authority (CA) that manages public keys.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Sender encrypts the message → Transmits over the Internet → Receiver decrypts using the shared key.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Cryptography Basics</h2>
        <p>Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plain Text:</strong> The original readable message.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Process of converting plain text to cipher text using a key.</li>
            <li><strong>Key:</strong> A value used in the encryption/decryption process.</li>
            <li><strong>Cipher Text:</strong> Encrypted, unreadable message.</li>
            <li><strong>Decryption:</strong> Converting cipher text back to plain text using the key.</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptanalysis:</strong> The study of breaking cryptographic systems without access to the key.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Plain Text: "HELLO"
Key: 3 (Caesar Cipher)
Cipher Text: "KHOOR"
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Public Key Encryption</h2>
        <p>Also known as Asymmetric Encryption, it uses two keys:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Key:</strong> Shared with everyone for encryption.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Key:</strong> Kept secret for decryption.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It ensures secure communication without sharing a private key.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Sender encrypts message using Receiver's Public Key → Only Receiver can decrypt using their Private Key.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Digital Signatures and Authentication</h2>
        <p>Digital signatures ensure message integrity and authenticity. They use the sender's private key to sign the data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Confirms the identity of the sender.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Signature:</strong> Encrypted hash of the message using sender’s private key.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Sender hashes the message → Encrypts hash with their Private Key → Receiver decrypts with Public Key and verifies hash.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <h1>UNIT-II: Network Security – Authentication Applications</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Kerberos</h2>
        <p><strong>Kerberos</strong> is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication using secret-key cryptography. It allows nodes to prove their identity over non-secure networks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses a Key Distribution Center (KDC) for ticket granting.</li>
            <li>Authenticates once, then uses tickets to access multiple services.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
1. User logs in → sends request to KDC.
2. KDC sends a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).
3. User presents TGT to access services without re-entering password.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. X.509 Authentication Service</h2>
        <p><strong>X.509</strong> is a standard defining the format of public key certificates. It is used in protocols like SSL/TLS for secure communications.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides a certificate that binds a public key with an identity.</li>
            <li>Issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
User A receives a digital certificate from a CA.
The certificate includes: User A’s public key + digital signature of CA.
Other users verify A’s identity by validating the certificate.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Directory Authentication Service</h2>
        <p>This service is often implemented using <strong>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)</strong>, which allows users and systems to look up authentication credentials in a centralized directory.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stores usernames, passwords, digital certificates.</li>
            <li>Supports authentication and access control.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A user logs in → system queries LDAP directory → credentials verified → access granted.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)</h2>
        <p><strong>PGP</strong> is a data encryption and decryption program used for secure communication and email encryption.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Combines symmetric encryption, public-key cryptography, and hashing.</li>
            <li>Used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting messages and files.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
1. Sender encrypts message using recipient’s public key.
2. Signs message using sender’s private key.
3. Receiver decrypts using private key and verifies signature with sender’s public key.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)</h2>
        <p><strong>S/MIME</strong> is a standard for public key encryption and signing of MIME data, widely used in securing email communication.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides confidentiality, message integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.</li>
            <li>Uses X.509 certificates for key management.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
User sends an encrypted email using recipient’s public key.
Recipient decrypts with their private key.
Sender’s digital signature ensures message is authentic.

<div class="topic-container" id="unit3">
    <h1>UNIT-III: IP Security Architecture</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Overview of IP Security (IPSec)</h2>
        <p><strong>IPSec</strong> is a suite of protocols that provide security for IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet. It operates at the network layer and ensures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Encrypts data to keep it private.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensures data is not altered during transit.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifies the sender of the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Without IPSec: Data travels over the internet in plain text.
With IPSec: Data is encrypted and authenticated, making it unreadable and tamper-proof.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Authentication Header (AH)</h2>
        <p><strong>Authentication Header</strong> is an IPSec protocol that provides data integrity and authentication of IP packets. It does not provide encryption.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensures the packet is not modified in transit.</li>
            <li>Verifies the identity of the sender.</li>
            <li>Works by adding an additional header to the packet.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Sender → creates AH header with hash of the packet using a shared secret key.
Receiver → recalculates hash and compares → if matched, data is authentic.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)</h2>
        <p><strong>ESP</strong> provides both encryption (confidentiality) and optional authentication. It can work in two modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transport Mode:</strong> Only the payload is encrypted.</li>
            <li><strong>Tunnel Mode:</strong> Entire IP packet is encrypted and encapsulated in a new IP packet.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Using ESP in Tunnel Mode:
Original IP packet → Encrypted and encapsulated → New IP header added → Transmitted securely.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Combining Security Associations</h2>
        <p><strong>Security Association (SA)</strong> is a relationship between two entities that defines how they communicate securely using IPSec.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each SA is unidirectional and uses a unique SPI (Security Parameter Index).</li>
            <li>To achieve full-duplex communication, two SAs are required (one in each direction).</li>
            <li>Multiple SAs can be combined for layered protection (e.g., AH + ESP).</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
To secure data with both integrity and encryption:
1. Use ESP for encryption.
2. Use AH for authentication.
Combined SA: ESP + AH.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Key Management</h2>
        <p><strong>Key Management</strong> in IPSec involves creating, distributing, and maintaining cryptographic keys used in secure communication. It can be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manual Keying:</strong> Keys are configured manually on both ends (not scalable).</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Keying:</strong> Uses protocols like IKE (Internet Key Exchange) to establish keys dynamically.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
IKE Phase 1: Establish secure channel between peers.
IKE Phase 2: Negotiate IPSec SAs and generate keys for encryption/authentication.
        </pre>

    <h1>UNIT-IV: Web Security</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Web Security Requirements</h2>
        <p>To ensure secure communication over the web, certain fundamental requirements must be met:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Only the intended recipient should access the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensure that the data is not altered during transmission.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Both parties must verify each other's identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> The sender cannot deny sending the message.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A user logs into a bank site → credentials are encrypted (confidentiality)
→ server checks authenticity (authentication)
→ a digital signature confirms user’s transaction (non-repudiation).
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</h2>
        <p><strong>SSL</strong> is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. It ensures that all data passed remains private.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.</li>
            <li>Employs digital certificates to verify server authenticity.</li>
            <li>Data is encrypted using session keys after handshake.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
1. Browser connects to a secure site (https).
2. Server sends SSL certificate.
3. Browser verifies certificate and creates a session key.
4. All communication is encrypted using the session key.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Transport Layer Security (TLS)</h2>
        <p><strong>TLS</strong> is the successor to SSL and provides improved security features. It is the most widely used protocol for securing internet communication today.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Backwards-compatible with SSL but more secure.</li>
            <li>Provides encryption, authentication, and integrity checks.</li>
            <li>Used in web browsers, email, messaging, and VoIP.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
When you visit https://example.com, TLS ensures:
- The server is authentic.
- Data you submit is encrypted.
- No third party can modify your messages.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Secure Electronic Transactions (SET)</h2>
        <p><strong>SET</strong> is a protocol developed by Visa and MasterCard to secure credit card transactions over the internet. It focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and cardholder authentication.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encrypts payment information.</li>
            <li>Separates payment and order information for privacy.</li>
            <li>Uses digital certificates for both cardholder and merchant.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
1. Customer places order and encrypts payment info using merchant's and bank’s public keys.
2. Merchant processes order but can't see card details.
3. Bank decrypts payment info and completes transaction securely.

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Overview of SNMP Architecture</h2>
        <p><strong>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</strong> is a protocol used for managing devices on IP networks such as routers, switches, servers, printers, and more.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manager:</strong> The system used to control and monitor the activities of network devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Agent:</strong> Software running on a managed device that reports information to the manager.</li>
            <li><strong>Managed Devices:</strong> Devices like routers or switches that are monitored via SNMP.</li>
            <li><strong>MIB (Management Information Base):</strong> A database used by SNMP to manage network objects.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Network Admin (Manager) → sends SNMP request to Router (Agent) 
→ Router responds with system data using information from MIB.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. SNMPv1 Communication Facility</h2>
        <p><strong>SNMPv1</strong> is the original version of SNMP and provides basic network monitoring features. It operates over UDP and uses a simple request-response communication model.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses community strings (like passwords) for access control.</li>
            <li>Messages are sent in plain text – no encryption.</li>
            <li>Supported operations: <code>GET</code>, <code>SET</code>, <code>GETNEXT</code>, <code>TRAP</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
GET request: Manager asks Agent for a value (e.g., CPU usage).
SET request: Manager tells Agent to change a setting (e.g., restart service).
TRAP: Agent sends an alert to Manager when a fault occurs.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. SNMPv3 – Enhanced Security</h2>
        <p><strong>SNMPv3</strong> is the most secure version of SNMP. It adds strong authentication and data encryption features to SNMP communications.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Ensures messages are from valid sources using protocols like HMAC-MD5 or SHA.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy (Encryption):</strong> Encrypts messages using DES or AES to prevent eavesdropping.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Defines what operations users can perform using user-based security model (USM).</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Keeps track of code changes (e.g., Git).</li>
            <li><strong>Change Management:</strong> Approves and documents system updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Asset Management:</strong> Maintains an inventory of hardware/software.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Using Git:
1. Developers push code to remote repository.
2. Git tracks changes, merges branches, and logs authorship.
3. CM ensures rollback if new update causes failure.
