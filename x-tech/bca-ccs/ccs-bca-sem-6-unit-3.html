    <h1>UNIT-I: Introduction to E-Commerce</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Scope and Definition of Electronic Commerce</h2>
        <p><strong>Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce)</strong> refers to the buying and selling of goods and services using electronic networks, primarily the internet. It covers online transactions, digital marketing, logistics, and customer services.</p>
        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> E-commerce includes B2B (business to business), B2C (business to consumer), C2C (consumer to consumer), and C2B (consumer to business) models.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
- B2C: Amazon selling books to a customer
- B2B: A manufacturer ordering supplies from another company online
- C2C: OLX where users sell products to other users
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Electronic Commerce and the Trade Cycle</h2>
        <p>The <strong>trade cycle</strong> in e-commerce involves stages like product discovery, negotiation, order placement, delivery, and after-sales support. E-commerce speeds up and automates this process.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A customer visits Flipkart → adds a laptop to cart → places an order → payment → product delivered → post-purchase support
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Electronic Markets (E-Marketplaces)</h2>
        <p><strong>Electronic Markets</strong> are digital platforms where buyers and sellers interact and exchange goods/services. These platforms improve market efficiency by offering wider reach and faster transactions.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Amazon, Alibaba, eBay – platforms where multiple sellers offer products to customers.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)</h2>
        <p><strong>EDI</strong> is the computer-to-computer exchange of business documents like invoices, purchase orders, and shipping notices, without human intervention. It increases speed and accuracy.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A retail chain automatically sends purchase orders to suppliers using EDI when stock levels fall below a threshold.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Internet Commerce</h2>
        <p><strong>Internet Commerce</strong> is a form of e-commerce that uses the Internet to conduct business activities, including online marketing, order processing, secure payments, and customer support.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Using Google Ads to attract users to an online store → users browse and make a purchase via payment gateways like Razorpay.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. E-Commerce in Perspective</h2>
        <p>E-commerce has changed how businesses operate by making transactions faster, reducing costs, and expanding to a global market. It integrates technology, business processes, and customer interaction.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Traditional store limited to local customers.
Online store (like Nykaa) can serve across India with lower overhead.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <h2>Business Strategy in an Electronic Age</h2>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Supply Chains and Value Chain Model</h2>
        <p><strong>Supply Chain:</strong> The sequence of processes involved in the production and distribution of a product.</p>
        <p><strong>Porter’s Value Chain:</strong> Describes internal company activities that create value, categorized into primary and support activities.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Raw Material → Manufacturing → Packaging → Online Sales → Delivery
E-commerce reduces intermediaries, improving supply chain efficiency.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>8. Inter-Organizational Value Chains</h2>
        <p>These involve the coordination of value-adding activities between different companies, such as suppliers and retailers, using digital communication tools.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
BigBasket uses vendor networks to source groceries directly from farms and deliver to customers via its app.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>9. Competitive Strategy & Porter’s Five Forces</h2>
        <p><strong>Porter’s Five Forces:</strong> Analyze industry competition:
        <ul>
            <li>Threat of New Entrants</li>
            <li>Threat of Substitutes</li>
            <li>Bargaining Power of Suppliers</li>
            <li>Bargaining Power of Customers</li>
            <li>Industry Rivalry</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Flipkart uses deep discounts (competitive strategy) to retain customers against rivals like Amazon.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>10. First Mover Advantage & Sustainable Competitive Advantage</h2>
        <p><strong>First Mover Advantage:</strong> Gaining market share by entering the market early.</p>
        <p><strong>Sustainable Competitive Advantage:</strong> Long-term edge over competitors through innovation, customer service, or cost efficiency.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
- First mover: Amazon in online retail
- Sustainable: Google maintains advantage through continuous AI innovation
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>11. Business Strategy & Strategic IT Implications</h2>
        <p><strong>Business Strategy</strong> is a long-term plan to achieve goals. E-commerce affects strategy by enabling faster reach, automation, and cost-cutting.</p>
        <p><strong>Strategic Implications of IT:</strong> IT influences market positioning, customer engagement, and operational excellence.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Zomato's strategy involves rapid delivery and customer loyalty via tech-enabled logistics and apps.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>12. Technology, Environment, and Business Capability</h2>
        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Drives innovation and efficiency in business processes.</p>
        <p><strong>Environment:</strong> Includes market trends, competitors, and regulations.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Capability:</strong> Refers to an organization’s ability to deliver value using resources and strategy.</p>

Tech: Cloud computing for scalable websites  
Environment: Changing online shopping habits during festivals  
Capability: Ability to serve 10,000 users/day without downtime
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>13. Strategy Formulation & Implementation</h2>
        <p>Formulating a strategy involves defining vision, goals, and actions. Implementation is putting that plan into motion using people, tech, and processes.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Goal: Expand e-commerce to rural India  
Plan: Build mobile-friendly app + low-bandwidth site + local delivery partners  
Implementation: Train agents, deploy tech, launch campaign
        </pre>
    </section>

    <h1>UNIT-II: Business-to-Business Electronic Commerce</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Characteristics of B2B E-Commerce</h2>
        <p><strong>B2B (Business-to-Business) E-Commerce</strong> involves online transactions between businesses. It is typically high in volume, recurring, and deals with wholesale or raw materials.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Long-term relationships</li>
            <li>Negotiated pricing and bulk orders</li>
            <li>Automated order processing</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A textile company buys raw cotton in bulk from an online supplier platform monthly.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Models of B2B E-Commerce</h2>
        <p>There are several models through which B2B transactions occur:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supplier-Oriented:</strong> One supplier sells to many businesses (e.g., Amazon Business).</li>
            <li><strong>Buyer-Oriented:</strong> One buyer sets up a marketplace to invite suppliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Intermediary-Oriented:</strong> A third-party platform connects multiple buyers and sellers (e.g., Alibaba).</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
An automobile company creates a portal where multiple parts suppliers bid for contracts (Buyer-Oriented Model).
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Procurement Management Using Buyer’s Internal Marketplace</h2>
        <p>This refers to businesses managing purchasing internally using dedicated software portals where departments can request items.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
An IT company uses SAP to allow each department to request hardware and track procurement internally.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Just in Time (JIT) Delivery</h2>
        <p><strong>JIT Delivery</strong> ensures that products or materials are delivered exactly when needed, minimizing inventory and storage costs.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A car manufacturer receives tires daily, timed perfectly with its assembly line schedule to avoid warehouse costs.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Other B2B Models, Auctions, and Services</h2>
        <p>Besides standard marketplaces, B2B E-Commerce can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reverse Auctions:</strong> Buyers post needs and suppliers bid lowest.</li>
            <li><strong>Group Purchasing:</strong> Multiple buyers form a group for bulk discounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Platforms:</strong> Legal, logistics, or consulting services offered B2B online.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Government tenders operate as reverse auctions where companies bid to offer the lowest quote.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. From Traditional to Internet-Based EDI</h2>
        <p><strong>Traditional EDI:</strong> Used private networks, costly setup, limited access.</p>
        <p><strong>Internet-based EDI:</strong> Uses secure internet protocols, cheaper and accessible for small businesses.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Earlier, EDI was done over VANs (Value Added Networks). Now businesses use APIs and XML over HTTPS for fast and low-cost data exchange.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Integration with Back-End Information Systems</h2>
        <p>Modern B2B platforms integrate with systems like ERP, CRM, and inventory management for seamless operations and real-time updates.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
When a buyer places an order on a supplier's portal, it directly updates the inventory and accounting system.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>8. Role of Software Agents in B2B E-Commerce</h2>
        <p><strong>Software Agents</strong> are intelligent programs that assist in tasks like searching products, negotiating prices, or monitoring inventory.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A software bot monitors raw material prices across vendors and auto-suggests the lowest-price option to the purchase manager.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>9. Electronic Marketing in B2B</h2>
        <p>B2B electronic marketing uses emails, webinars, content marketing, and SEO to attract business clients rather than individual consumers.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A cloud services company publishes whitepapers and hosts webinars for IT managers to generate leads.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>10. Solutions of B2B E-Commerce</h2>
        <p>B2B platforms offer solutions such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automated order management</li>
            <li>Bulk pricing and credit terms</li>
            <li>Vendor portals and dashboards</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Zoho Commerce and Shopify Plus provide integrated B2B features like reseller pricing, customer-specific catalogs.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>11. Managerial Issues in B2B EC</h2>

            <li>Integration with legacy systems</li>
            <li>Vendor relationship and performance management</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A firm must ensure that supplier systems comply with GDPR and support integration with its own ERP.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>12. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)</h2>
        <p><strong>EDI</strong> allows companies to exchange standard business documents electronically. It improves speed, accuracy, and reduces paperwork.</p>
        <p>Documents shared: Purchase Orders, Invoices, Shipping Notices, etc.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A wholesaler receives an EDI purchase order from a retail chain and responds with an EDI shipping confirmation.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>13. EDI: The Nuts and Bolts</h2>
        <p><strong>How EDI works:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Documents are created in a standard format (e.g., ANSI X12, EDIFACT)</li>
            <li>Sent over secure channels like HTTPS, SFTP, or VAN</li>
            <li>Integrated into business applications automatically</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
- Step 1: Buyer creates order (EDI 850 format)  
- Step 2: Supplier sends back invoice (EDI 810 format)
- Step 3: Inventory and accounts updated automatically
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>14. EDI and Business</h2>
        <p>EDI plays a major role in making B2B transactions faster and less error-prone. It improves business relationships by automating routine tasks.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A chain of pharmacies uses EDI to reorder medicines from suppliers automatically, ensuring zero stockouts.
