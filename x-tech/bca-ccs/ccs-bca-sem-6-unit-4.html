    <h1>UNIT-I: Business Intelligence and Business Decisions</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Modeling Decision Process</h2>
        <p>The decision process in an organization can be modeled into three main phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Intelligence Phase:</strong> Identifying problems or opportunities</li>
            <li><strong>Design Phase:</strong> Developing possible solutions or alternatives</li>
            <li><strong>Choice Phase:</strong> Selecting the best solution based on data and analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This model helps decision-makers break down complex problems into logical steps and improve decision quality.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A retail chain notices declining sales (Intelligence) → Considers discounts, rebranding, or relocating stores (Design) → Chooses to offer combo discounts during weekends (Choice).
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Decision Support Systems (DSS)</h2>
        <p><strong>Decision Support Systems (DSS)</strong> are computer-based tools that help managers in making informed decisions using data, analytical models, and interactive software.</p>
        <p>Key features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data collection and analysis</li>
            <li>What-if analysis and forecasting</li>
            <li>Interactive dashboards and visualization</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A bank uses DSS to decide loan approvals. It analyzes customer income, credit history, and repayment trends to suggest approval or rejection.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS)</h2>
        <p><strong>Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS)</strong> extend DSS to support collaborative decision-making among multiple stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shared data access</li>
            <li>Real-time brainstorming tools</li>
            <li>Voting and consensus-building features</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A multinational company planning a new product launch uses GDSS to gather input from marketing, finance, and R&D teams across different countries.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Business Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
        <p><strong>Business Expert Systems</strong> are knowledge-based systems that mimic human expert decision-making in a specific domain using rules and logic.</p>
        <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> involves simulating human intelligence in machines—such as reasoning, learning, and self-correction.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expert Systems use "if-then" rules.</li>
            <li>AI applies machine learning, NLP, and neural networks for smarter automation.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A business expert system can suggest tax-saving options based on income profile.
AI in banking can detect fraud by learning user transaction patterns.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) & OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)</h2>
        <p><strong>OLTP</strong> systems manage day-to-day transactional data (insert, update, delete) like sales, orders, or payments in real time.</p>
        <p><strong>OLAP</strong> systems support complex queries and data analysis by summarizing large datasets across dimensions like time, location, and product.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
OLTP: ATM withdrawal system records debit transactions instantly.
OLAP: A retail manager analyzes weekly sales across regions and product categories.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Data Warehousing</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Data Warehouse</strong> is a central repository where data from multiple sources is collected, cleaned, and stored for reporting and analysis purposes.</p>
        <p>It helps decision-makers access historical data in a consistent format.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A university maintains a data warehouse to track student performance trends over years, combining results, attendance, and placement data.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Marts</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Marts</strong> are smaller, subject-specific versions of data warehouses. They focus on a single department or function like sales, HR, or finance.</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
While a company’s data warehouse stores company-wide data, the Sales Data Mart contains only sales reports, targets, and customer trends.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Data Warehouse Architecture</h2>
        <p>The architecture of a data warehouse typically includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> CRM, ERP, flat files, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>ETL Tools:</strong> Extract, Transform, Load data into the warehouse</li>
            <li><strong>Staging Area:</strong> Temporary space for cleaning data</li>
            <li><strong>Data Warehouse:</strong> Central repository</li>
            <li><strong>Data Marts & BI Tools:</strong> For analysis and visualization</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Salesforce CRM → ETL process → Warehouse (e.g., AWS Redshift) → Power BI Dashboard
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Tools for Data Warehousing</h2>
        <p>Several tools are used to build, manage, and analyze data in a warehouse:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ETL Tools:</strong> Talend, Informatica, Apache Nifi</li>
            <li><strong>Database Systems:</strong> Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Oracle</li>
            <li><strong>BI Tools:</strong> Tableau, Power BI, QlikView</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>UNIT-III: Multi-Dimensional Analysis and Data Mining</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Multi-Dimensional Analysis</h2>
        <p><strong>Multi-dimensional analysis</strong> involves examining data across multiple dimensions (like time, product, location) to uncover trends and relationships.</p>
        <p>This is often done using OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) tools which allow users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Slice: View one dimension (e.g., sales in January)</li>
            <li>Dice: View data across two or more dimensions (e.g., sales in January by region)</li>
            <li>Drill down/up: Go from summary to detailed view and vice versa</li>
            <li>Pivot: Rotate data to view it from different angles</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A company analyzes sales data:
- Dimensions: Time, Region, Product
- Question: What were the total mobile phone sales in South India in Q1 2024?
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Mining</strong> is the process of automatically discovering patterns, trends, and relationships in large datasets using statistical, mathematical, or AI techniques.</p>
        <p><strong>Knowledge Discovery</strong> is a broader process that includes data selection, preprocessing, data mining, and interpretation of results.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data cleaning → Integration → Selection → Mining → Evaluation</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
An e-commerce platform discovers that users who buy headphones often buy phone covers too. 
This knowledge helps in bundling or cross-selling products.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Data Mining Techniques</h2>
        <p>Common techniques used in data mining include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Assigning items into categories (e.g., spam or not spam)</li>
            <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation)</li>
            <li><strong>Association Rule Mining:</strong> Discovering relationships (e.g., Market Basket Analysis)</li>
            <li><strong>Regression:</strong> Predicting a numeric value (e.g., sales forecast)</li>
            <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Identifying unusual data (e.g., fraud detection)</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
- Classification: Email → spam or not spam using machine learning  
- Association Rule: "80% of users who bought shoes also bought socks"
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Mining of Advanced Databases</h2>
        <p>Advanced databases include structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats like:</p>

    <h1>UNIT-IV: Knowledge Management Systems (KMS)</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Concept of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS)</h2>
        <p><strong>Knowledge Management Systems (KMS)</strong> are tools and processes that help organizations capture, store, share, and apply knowledge to enhance performance and decision-making.</p>
        <p>KMS supports both <strong>explicit knowledge</strong> (documents, databases) and <strong>tacit knowledge</strong> (experience, insights).</p>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A company’s internal portal with training manuals, FAQs, best practices, and expert advice is a Knowledge Management System.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Structure of KMS</h2>
        <p>The structure of a typical Knowledge Management System includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Repository:</strong> Stores documents, reports, case studies, FAQs, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Acquisition Tools:</strong> Capture knowledge from experts (e.g., interviews, surveys)</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Sharing Platforms:</strong> Forums, intranets, groupware tools</li>
            <li><strong>Search & Retrieval Tools:</strong> Enable users to locate and access required knowledge</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration Tools:</strong> Chats, meetings, version control for documents</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
Google Drive (storage) + Google Meet (sharing) + Google Docs (collaboration) form a basic KMS structure in many companies.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Techniques of Knowledge Management</h2>
        <p>Organizations use various techniques to manage knowledge effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Codification:</strong> Converting tacit knowledge into documents or databases</li>
            <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Direct person-to-person sharing of insights and expertise</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Mapping:</strong> Identifying who knows what within the organization</li>
            <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Sharing lessons through real-world stories</li>
            <li><strong>Communities of Practice (CoP):</strong> Informal networks of experts sharing knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="matrix">
Example:
A software company documents its troubleshooting steps (codification) and also encourages team meetings where senior developers share experiences (personalization).
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Appreciation and Limitations of KMS</h2>
        <p><strong>Appreciation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improves decision-making and innovation</li>
            <li>Reduces duplication of effort</li>
            <li>Preserves organizational memory</li>
            <li>Boosts employee productivity and training</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resistance to knowledge sharing</li>
            <li>High initial setup cost</li>
            <li>Difficult to capture tacit knowledge</li>
            <li>Needs constant updating and validation</li>
        </ul>
